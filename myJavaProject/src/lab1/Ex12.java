/*Write and test a program that maintains a set of student ids(integer in the range 701-799) and
coursework mark for each student (integer the range 0 to 100). The program will allow the user
to input the student id and the coursework mark for each student and store these data in a two
dimensional array. After all the input has been entered, the program will display the ids of the
students with the highest and the lowest coursework marks.*/
